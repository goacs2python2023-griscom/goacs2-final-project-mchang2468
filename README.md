## FINAL PROJECT: Statistical Analysis of NBA Player Efficiency
Research Completed by Michael Chang

My goal with this project was to analyze and visualize historic data of National Basketball Association (NBA) players' statistics to identify the most efficient NBA players. Analyzing over seven decades of advanced metrics such as player efficiency rating (PER), I have achieved this goal. This research has the potential to improve basketball training and education, as well as to further the evolution of the game.
