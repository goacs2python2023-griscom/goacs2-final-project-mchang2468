## FINAL PROJECT: Statistical Analysis of NBA Player Efficiency
Research Completed by Michael Chang

My goal with this project was to analyze and visualize historic data of National Basketball Association (NBA) players' statistics to identify the most efficient NBA players. Analyzing over seven decades of advanced metrics such as player efficiency rating (PER), I have achieved this goal. I created seven histograms. The first histogram displays the players with the highest season-long PERs and the seasons in which they did it. The remaining six histograms compare individual, simpler statistics for the top 10 players in terms of single-season PER. Created by ESPN columnist John Hollinger, PER tracks measures the efficiency of individual players through analysis of many factors including individual metrics such as minutes played, assists, and rebounds; team metrics such as team field goals made, team assists, and team pace; and league-wide metrics such as league assists, league points, and league rebounds. Since there are so many factors within the calculation for PER, the formula will not be written here. Instead, the formula can be found through this link (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_efficiency_rating#Calculation) in case anyone is interested. This research has the potential to improve basketball training and education, as well as to further the evolution of the game.
